# jddos - Easy to use DDOS Python Tool.

I uploaded the Compiled and Uncompiled version.

If you want to compile it yourself you can use `pyinstaller --onefile main.py`

# Usage
After launch, Enter the target IP, the Disguise, the port and the number of packets being sent.

# Linux
Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/Jxkss/jddos`
Startup with : `python3 main.py`
